// The work sits as a vertical drum: the card at the front lies flat and full
// size, the ones above and below rotate away into hard perspective and run off
// the top and bottom of the frame, and each card carries its name beneath it.
// Turning the wheel carries the next piece round to the front. Scrolling down
// pulls the drum down (see the wheel handler) - the covers move the way a hand
// would drag them.
//
// The whole thing is one number - `turn` - read by a single rAF pass that writes
// transforms straight to the DOM. 1 is the drum with item 0 at the front, and
// every whole number after that is one more item turned past. 0 is the ring, an
// intro state the wheel no longer opens on; `to()` floors at 1 so it is never
// reached.
